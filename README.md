# Playlist-Downloader
A playlist downloader for Beat Saber

# Warning
The default Path to Beat Saber is set as "C:\\SteamLibrary\\steamapps\\common\\Beat Saber", to change it, edit the json and replace this path with the right one, the path needs to lead to the Beat Saber directory, NOT PLAYLIST OR CUSTOM MAPS ONE

# No GUI
There isn't any GUI and there will probably never be one, Sorry about that

# Feedback
I obviously need feedbacks about bugs etc... If something go wrong, DM me on discord : Mor√©o#0001 or open an issue on GitHub.
